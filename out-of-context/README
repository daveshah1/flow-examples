# nextpnr out-of-context flow

This demonstrates a flow that places and routes a small picorv32 SoC
"out-of-context" - i.e. with no IO or global buffer insertion - and
saves it as a place-and-routed JSON that can then be used as a 
"hardened" submodule.

This submodule is then used in a larger module that adds a firmware
ROM, some IO and a PLL. This means changes to any of these three
parts do not necessitate a full rebuild of the picorv32.

Currently there is one example for the ECP5 Versa-5G evaluation board.
Run `make prog` to build all parts and program the board using openocd.
Connect to the serial at 9600 baud, type a message, and it should be
scrolled on the 14-seg display after pressing Enter.
